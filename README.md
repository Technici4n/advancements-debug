# Advancements Debug

This little mod rewrites one function of the advancements logic to make advancements checking faster, and use less recursion. It should prevent StackOverflowErrors with advancements.
 
If `net.minecraft.class_2985.method_12885` appears in the crash log, this mod is likely going to fix it.<br>
(Or `net.minecraft.advancement.PlayerAdvancementTracker.updateDisplay` if you are using Not Enough Crashes).

This mod can be installed on the server-side only if you are having issues on a server, but it can also be useful on the client when playing in single-player words.
